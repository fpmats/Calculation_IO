Repository for the inputs and outputs for all VASP calculations for the following publication: 
  Tina Mihm, Kasidet Jing Trerayapiwat, Xinxin Li, Xuedan Ma, and Sahar Sharifzadeh "Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs" Under review 

Each calculation directory contains the following files: 
1. INCAR - VASP input file with all flags used to run each calculation 
2. POSCAR - VASP file with the structure information 
3. KPOINT - VASP input file with the k-mesh grid information including k-points used 
4. OUTCAR - VASP output with all details on the completed calculation 
5. vasp.out - VASP output with all output information and errors of the calculation while running 
6. bs.json - json file that contains the bandstructure information used for graphing the 
   band structure (only in the 03_BS directory) 

The top directories are named after the defect and binding configuration for each defect.
All sub directories are as follows: 
 - "d-pos" - calculation information for the dopants bound purpendicular to the tube axis, i.e. "d" orientation 
 - "l-pos" - calculation information for the dopants bound along the tube axis, i.e. "l" orientation 
 - "01_AOPT" - calculation details for the atomic optomization step, step 1
 - "02_SCF" - calculation details for the SCF step, step 2 
 - "03_BS" - calculation details for the bandstructure step, step 3

The "Defects" directory contains the calculation details for the lone defect without the CNT. 
 - It contains the same files as listed above. 

The "Scripts" directory contains two analysis scripts: 
 - "Plot_BS_graph.py" - uses the generated bs.json file and graphs the band structure as a png
 - "Plot_PDOS_graph.py" - Reads in the DOSCAR and projects the orbitals to generate a PDOS as a png
