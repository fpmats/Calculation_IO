|     You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells it     |
|     might be more efficient to use real-space projection operators.         |
|     Therefore, try LREAL= Auto in the INCAR file.                           |
|     Mind: If you want to do very accurate calculations, keep the            |
|     reciprocal projection scheme (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.).                      |
